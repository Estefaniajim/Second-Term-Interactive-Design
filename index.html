      <h5><i>How did you apply (or not) iterative design in your project?</i></h5>

        <br><li>We made software blueprints</li>
<li>Analyzing the requirements of the information we needed</li>
<li>We evaluate our results every time we made a change to the code</li>
<li>After evaluating we decided what we are keeping and what we are removing from the web page always taking care of the simplicity laws</li>

</br>
<h5><i>Describe the main highlights of your persona</i></h5>

  <br>
<li>The 62,5% of the surveyed have declared to not being inform about prevention methods.</li>
<li>The 100,0% of the surveyed recognize the importance of being informed about this</li>
<li>The 100,0% of the surveyed find important to talk about this theme with children</li>
<li>More than the 50,0% of the surveyed think that the situation of “trata de blancas” is not common in this city</li>
<li>The 93,8% of the surveyed knows the term of “trata de personas”</li>
<li>Explain the audience of your project: Most of it are teenegers and adults, specially parents, we are not aiming children because we estimate that they may not be interested by their own or they would be scared about this, instead of this parents are one of our aims in order to them inform their children.</li>

</br>
<h5><i>Explain, in your own words, the three principles of system design</i>
</h5>

  <br> By analyzing the requirements make a blueprint of the prototype, analyze the risks or possible issues for them to be presented, make a prototype, polish and start with the new blueprint successively

</br>
<h5><i>Create your own methodology to develop a website. It’s important to justify all the steps
</i></h5>

  <br>
  <li>Make a demo  on paper, including the things you need for your project, such as the need of your customer and how he wants the webpage to look like. </li>
<li>Start looking for the technologies you are gonna use, such as framework and the language you are gonna use. ex.  Go, javascript, etc.</li>
<li>Make a real memo, with basic coding but just to show it to your customer and to make any early changes.</li>

<li>Gather all the information you are gonna use in your page, example, if it is a webpage about cakes, then get the information about the types of cakes, the shop and all the information that the customer wants in their page.</li>
<li>Start with the coding, use the framework and the language you choose in the previous steps. </li>
<li>Debug any issues you have with the code </li>
<li>After you finish, show it to the customer for finals changes, after this if the customer wants another change you should charged the customer a small amount.</li>
<li>Get paid or graded if it is for a school project. </li>

          <h5><i>Effort</i></h5>
<br> We shared(almost spammed) the quiz with every group we had and we try to contact with many experts until one of them finally responded, taking in consideration the difficulty to find experts of “trata de personas” and we tried really hard to find an expert that lives in Guadalajara so we were able to make an presencial interview  28/30 </br>

<h5><i>Result</i></h5>
<br> Our results are good, the web page have a organic feeling, it contains most of the practices that que have made on classes, we have maintain it simple and informative, most of the people who we asked an opinion about the project have said that they like it.	65/70
</br>
<h5><i>Explain the status of your interview.
</i></h5>
<br>
<ol>

<li>Who is your expert?  Maricarmen Rello
</li>
  <li>Why? We selected him because she have wrote one of the documents which information we used to do our web page in addition to this she is from Guadalajara
  </li>
  <li>Who is your user? We don’t have this information yet.  </li>
</ol>
</br>
<h5><i>Ask another team for their proposal. Compare it with yours. </i></h5>
<br>
<ol>

<li>Which one is better? Their proposal is better

</li>
  <li>Why? We are not currently taking in consideration transport in our proposal in addition to this, they made an in-depth investigation about the servers and maintenance costs, we should investigate more and fundament our own proposal in order to be clear with every potential client reading our proposal

  </li>
</ol>

 </br>
<h5><i>Is your project responsive? Explain.
</i></h5>
<br> Not at all, our web page have many issues talking about a reader in smartphone in a vertical position, however you can navigate through it and read it at all no matters from where you are looking at it </br>
<h5><i>In your project did you follow the first three laws of simplicity?

</i></h5>
<br>We don’t have so much functionalities, each button have a reason to be and it does make the web page to feel comfortable. The web page is well organized, we may have so much information but it has a space in parallel with the other information. We don’t follow the third law at all, our introduction is so big that this may distract the reader or even make him “waste his time”, we could aim this focusing what we want to do and how we are going to do it. </br>
<h5><i>Grade your second term

</i></h5>

<li> Estefania: 95</li></br>
